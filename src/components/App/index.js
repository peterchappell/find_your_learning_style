      <p>This questionnaire is designed to find out your preferred learning style(s).
        Over the years you have probably developed learning &quot;habits&quot; that
        help you benefit more from some experiences than from others. Since you are
        probably unaware of this, this questionnaire will help you pinpoint your
        learning preferences so that you are in a better position to select learning
        experiences that suit your style and having a greater understanding of those
        that suit the style of others.</p>
      <p>This is an internationally proven tool designed by Peter Honey and Alan Mumford.</p>
      <p>There is no time limit to this questionnaire. It will probably take you 10-15
        minutes. The accuracy of the results depends on how honest you can be. There are
        no right or wrong answers.</p>
